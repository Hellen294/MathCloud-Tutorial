            <p><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
            <p>All children have a right to receive their education free from humiliation, oppression, and abuse. It is the responsibility of adults to ensure that the school provides a caring and protective environment for them. Bullying behavior takes place in every school at some time, and affects everyone directly or indirectly. The results of fear and intimidation spread beyond the circle of bully and victim.</p>

            <p><strong>What is bullying?</strong></p>
            <p>It is important to distinguish between bullying and rough play/arguments. The following features help to identify bullying:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It is deliberately hostile towards the victim and often repeated.</li>
                <li>The victim is less powerful than the bully or bullies.</li>
                <li>The outcome is always painful and distressing for the victim.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>The four main types of bullying are:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physical:</strong> persistent hitting, pushing, kicking, pinching, other violence, and taking things.</li>
                <li><strong>Verbal:</strong> name-calling, sarcasm, racist remarks, persistent teasing, threatening.</li>
                <li><strong>Indirect:</strong> spreading rumors, excluding someone from social groups.</li>
                <li><strong>Cyber:</strong> areas of the internet, such as email and internet chat room misuse, mobile threats through text messaging and calls, misuse of associated technology i.e. camera and video facilities.</li>
            </ul>
